## Architecture
This application follows so called React/flux style, and uses parts like components, screens, context and other service functions.

## State handling 
As this application is build with react-native it uses useStates and other hooks for handling states

## Readable code
Code is readable and files are named logically. We could have split some code from screens to multiple components, but sience they were not used multiple times we decided to not to refactor them.
